To display the list of instances of the `CourseStructure` model along with their corresponding content,
you can use the `SingleCourseStructureListDisplayView` API view. Here's how you can implement it:

```python
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from .models import CourseStructure, UploadReadingMaterial, UploadVideo, Quiz

class SingleCourseStructureListDisplayView(APIView):
    """
    View to display the list of instances of the course structure table, whose course ID is in the URL.
    Triggered with a GET request.
    Should be allowed for all users who have access to LMS.
    """

    def get(self, request, course_id):
        # Retrieve all course structures for the given course ID
        course_structures = CourseStructure.objects.filter(course_id=course_id)

        # Initialize an empty list to store the serialized data
        serialized_data = []

        # Iterate through each course structure instance
        for structure in course_structures:
            # Serialize the course structure instance
            serialized_structure = {
                "order_number": structure.order_number,
                "content_type": structure.content_type,
                "content_id": structure.content_id
            }

            # Fetch and include the content for the current structure
            content = structure.get_content()
            if content:
                serialized_structure["content"] = content.serialize()  # Assuming you have a serialize method in each content model

            # Append the serialized structure to the list
            serialized_data.append(serialized_structure)

        # Return the serialized data as a JSON response
        return Response(serialized_data)
```

In this view:

- We first retrieve all instances of `CourseStructure` that belong to the specified course ID (`course_id`).

- Then, for each `CourseStructure` instance, we serialize its fields (`order_number`, `content_type`, `content_id`). Additionally, we fetch the corresponding content based on the `content_type` and include it in the serialized data.

- Assuming that the content models (`UploadReadingMaterial`, `UploadVideo`, `Quiz`) have a `serialize()` method that returns a serialized representation of the content, we call this method and include the serialized content in the response.

- Finally, we return the serialized data as a JSON response.

Make sure to adjust the `serialize()` method according to your content models to provide the appropriate serialized representation of the content.
